In this application we have created a FORM and send the entered data to "https://webhook.site/".
To check the sent data, you can go to "https://webhook.site/" and generate your unique URL and
inserting it into "src/utils /constants". Or use an existing one.

We used dependencies:
material ui - for layout
react-hook-form - for working with forms and state

To load all dependencies in the terminal enter: npm install

To run the project in the terminal, enter: npm srart
